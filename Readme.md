fwkit
=====

A modular approach to iptables-based firewall rulesets.

*fwkit* is primarily designed around the concept of *roles* and *services*. Roles maintain a collection of enabled services. A ruleset is compiled based on the services enabled within the current role. Roles can be customized to suit any need, and a number of roles are configured by default.
