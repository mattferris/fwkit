pkg_description="A modular approach to iptables-based firewall rulesets
 fwkit is primarily designed around the concept of roles and services. Roles maintain a collection of enabled services. A ruleset is compiled based on the services enabled for the active role. Roles can be customized to suit any need, and a number of roles are configured by default."
